Warm up
```
var musician = "Prince";

if (musician == "Prince") {
	console.log("you are a genius with great tastes");
} else {
	console.log("you probably spelled Prince wrong");
}
```

Data types: 

Data type is a kind basic nugget of info in a program. What kind of data type you'll need is what you want to get out of it. 

String = "words"
Number = whole numbers or decimals ex. 1.3, 1000021
Boolean = true of false 
Array = collctions of data ex. ['Steven', 'Garnet', 'Pearl']
Object = 

= an assignment 
== are the vaules the same
=== are the values and the data type the same

Primatives (sting, number, boolean) and derived (array)

Variables = store data types
keywords - reserved words in language that cannot be used for variable or function names ex var

Arrays: 

Great for:
- storing data
- Enumerating data (ie using an index to find them)
- compose a data structure that is similar in concept to a list
- Elements
- In JavaScript, arrays can dynamically grow and shrink in size 

An array declaration - can create an array but dont need items in it yet
```
> a = new Array();
[]
> a[0] = "sloth";
'sloth'
> a[1] = "hedgehog";
'hedgehog'
```

Arrays can have a difference in value and in length

Array methods: 
a.toString()
a.pop()
a.push()
a.reverse()
a.shift()
a.unshift()


Control Structure: 
They allow the program flow to change within a unit of code or function: if/else, for loops

Truthy and Falsey: 

false: 
- false
- 0 
- undefined

falsey: 
- "" (empty string)
- null
- NaN

Everything else is true

Booleans 

Binary Operators: 
- AND (denoted &&)
- OR (denoted ||) 

Unary Operators:
- NOT(denoted !)

If Else:

if (expr has to be a truthy or false statement){ 
	code
}

Ternary Operator

var x = (expr) ? {true code} : {false code}
